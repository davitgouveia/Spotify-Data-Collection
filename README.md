# Spotify Data Collection with Python :musical_keyboard: #

This script is part of a college project of data-analysis with AI.

**:wrench:Tools:**

 - Spotify WEB API 
 - Spotipy 
 - Pandas

In this project I consumed Spotify WEB API with Spotipy library to generate a .csv dataframe with Pandas.

The script is able to understand the response of a query for 2023 tracks, shield against None singletons and format it, but it's still a WIP, I'm currently trying to figure out a way of read more than 1000 tracks.
